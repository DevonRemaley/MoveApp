# MoveApp

Move is a user intended MVC application designed to get you moving. With all the features to record and save your ride, while also providing calories burned based off of the time you've spent moving. In a busy world, make sure to keep riding! Access previous routes/times when you need to get a quick ride in on lunch, link and share routes with others, and much much more!!

Strava and Google Routes integrations coming soon!!
